- This is a container for template files used at the Nordic Institute 
    for the Studies of Innovation, Research and Education (NIFU). Templates are 
    specifically developed for the Quarto/Saros based outputs, such as YAML, 
    QMD, Lua, DOCX, CSS and CitationStyles. Note that some Quarto extensions are
    available in separate packages/extensions; see e.g. 
    <https://github.com/NIFU-NO/nifutypst>, <https://github.com/NIFU-NO/nifudocx>.
